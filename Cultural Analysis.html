			<p>Technology is evolving at a fast pace these days.  With these developments video games are becoming far more realistic.  This is both a good thing and a bad thing.  It provides for better games and amazing graphics.  On the downside it portrays violence more accurately.  Children’s minds are like a sponge and absorb a lot of the things they see. This makes it easy for them to take in things they see in the media or in video games.  When they become adults they are almost completely surrounded by mass media. This violence that children see at a young age could change their morals and possibly cause problems later in their life because they were overly exposed to violence at a young age.  The media also covers acts of violence like the recent Newtown shooting and the Boston Massacre which gives a boatload of exposure to these violent crimes.  The problem doesn’t reside with the children though, the root is with the parents.  Children don’t know what is good for them at a young age and they believe they should be able to play any game no matter the rating. This puts parents in a tough situation. Most parents are good at keeping things from their kids, but a lot either don’t know what their children are seeing or just don’t care.  As a solution to this problem I would recommend making the ratings of the games harsher and make it harder for kids to get these games.  Violence in video games is an issue that our country should pay more attention to because it can change the direction of thought of these young children for the worse.</p>
			<p>The origin of video games dates a while back to early arcade games and simple games.  But as technology evolved a wider range of games were becoming available to the world.  Along with the different types of games, games were getting more realistic and better looking.  In 20 years video games have advanced exponentially.  In the first Madden game which depicts NFL Football characters were 2D and things were far from actual football.  This year the 25th edition of Madden Football came out and has physics generators that can depict a tackle in the game to look almost exactly the same as it would in real life. Video games have also become more and more violent because of the advanced technology.  In the 90’s people were playing unrealistic games against just friends on the same TV. Now kids can play war games that provide the realism of war.  Things have also advanced so that anyone around the world can play against each other.  At any given time I can be playing a multiplayer first person shooter against someone across the planet.  Violence is also becoming more and more accepted in society.  Nineties television consisted of weird sitcoms and friendly cartoons.  Now you can turn on the TV and probably be able to find a show like CSI or somehow related to police work/homicide.  In the recent release of Grand Theft Auto 5 which is fun for mature teens and adults to play, it should be nowhere near the hands of children.  In this game you can go to strip clubs, smoke marijuana, get drunk at bars, mindlessly kill civilians, and even hire prostitutes. This makes for a fun game for college students and high schoolers but if it gets into the hands of children it could cause problems.  As a child I was never allowed to play any Grand Theft Auto game. I didn’t agree with this as a kid but I definitely do now because these games are awfully violent and if you haven’t matured enough to be able to handle it then it can affect you in the wrong way. There have been several instances where children are addicted to video games and commit violent crimes later in their life because of these games. Sports video games are a good way for children to learn the actual sport.  I have never been much of a football fan but through playing football video games my knowledge of the sport has increased greatly.  Not all video games are bad and a lot of games can be good for children.  On the other hand though, come games can be detrimental to a child’s brain development. Obviously video games are becoming more violent and we should do something to keep these bad games out of the hands of our children.</p>
			<p>In the previous paragraph I showed that violence does exist in several video games today.  But how do these violent games affect children?  In an article from the New York Times Bendict Carey writes “The young men who opened fire at Columbine High School, at the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and in other massacres had this in common: they were video gamers who seemed to be acting out some dark digital fantasy. It was as if all that exposure to computerized violence gave them the idea to go on a rampage — or at least fueled their urges”. (Carey) Playing violent video games might not have been the leading cause in these acts of violence but they definitely were a problem.  More than once there has been a situation where an aggressive person plays too many video games and when they cant get their anger out in the game they take it out in real life.  The recent shooting at the Naval base in Washington was another shooting were video games played a role.  A friend of the shooter said, “Alexis was often late to his job because he was staying up all night playing video games.” Also commenting on the same shooting televangelist Pat Robertson worried that, “the life-altering effects of violent video games was carrying over to the real world.” (Studies)  Clearly there are links between acts of mass violence and video games.  All the blame cannot be placed on video games because that simply isn’t true.  Many of these people have serious mental issues but we can’t overlook the problems that overplaying video games or playing violent games as a child may cause. These games don’t press violence upon the children but it does change what is normal for them.  If a kid kills someone in a video game it isn’t that big of a deal.  As this goes on children begin to lose feeling for murder or other crimes because they have seen it so much that it has less meaning to them. Video games can be good for brain development as a child but it can also hurt them if they are exposed to things that they aren’t ready for.</p>
			<p>Violent video games are causing problems for many children even though they don’t even know it.  The ratings placed on games are already pretty strict.  Games rated M for mature are only available for purchase if you are above 17 years old.  But some T for Teen rated games are still sometimes too much for a young child’s brain. Games are not looked at the same way they were in the past though.  Games rated T in today’s society might have been rated M back in the day.  This could continue to happen in the future as media portrays violence more and more.  It is hard to think where technology will be in twenty years anyway.  I have no idea what the industry will be like then but I do know that shooting games are here to stay because of the wide fan base they have.  A proposal I have to make this resolve some of these issues is putting the rating on the front of the game instead of the back. This would help people buying the game to know what they are getting.  Many family members have trouble getting birthday or Christmas gifts for kids so they just get the current video game that is creating a buzz.  These people might not know what is in the game only that it is popular.  By putting the ratings on the cover of the game it would make it known what violence or inappropriate things might be in the game.  Another idea that might decrease this is a setting on the gaming system or in the game that can limit the amount of time a child can play in one day.  Once the child maxed out his or her time then he wouldn’t be able to play video games and will find something better to do than play a violent video game.  A lot of responsibility is on the parents in these situations though.  Most American parents can censor what their child sees or plays.  It’s the parents that don’t pay attention to what their children is being displayed where problems arise.  TV advertisements showing the negative effects of too much video games or too violent video games would be a great way to get the message out.  There are thousands of games out there that are great for children to play for brain development but there is a level of maturity that is needed to play some games. Every young boy tries to make weapons out of everything so it isn’t uncommon for young boys to be aggressive but video games might make it worse.  I know several kids who played inappropriate games as young children and they didn’t turn out to be very successful people. They don’t get great grades and they aren’t nice people to be around quite frankly. </p>
			<p>The video game industry generates about 16 billion dollars every year.  It is obviously a major piece in our society especially among children.  So keeping violent games out of the hands of children should be in the interests of our country.  Although the current rating system on video games is good things can be done to keep violent video games away from children.  Things like putting the rating on the front of the box and making parents or potential buyers of the game more aware of what they are getting their children.  Another thing that could be done is placing limits on how much a child can play a specific game. This would not only keep harmful thoughts out of a child’s head but help them develop other skills.  Time spent not playing video games would be spent doing other things like maybe playing outside or spending time with family.  As games get more and more violent we should be getting more and more protective of what children are seeing in video games.  This is hard to do on a national level because everything depends on the censorship parents place on their children.  So as time goes on parents need to do research on what is in their children’s games and protect them from something they shouldn’t see.</p>
