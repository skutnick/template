					<h1>Formal Research Project</h1>
			<p>Engineers have some of the most important jobs in the world.  Everything that isn’t on the earth naturally (trees, grass, etc.) was made by engineers.  The goal for engineers on a very large scale is to make everything safer and more efficient.  Engineers are constantly coming up with new technologies and systems that are a part of our lives every day. In order for this to happen a massive amount of writing and research goes on behind the lines.  Engineers have a problem that needs to be solved for their projects, to solve the problem they use their research or a publication of another engineer.  Most of the time they need to come up with a new solution to an ongoing problem.  This means that they must come up with something that has never been done before which requires a great amount of intellectual skill. Writing in the field of engineering is also critical in providing progress reports. Many times when working on a task, an update is needed.  So an engineer will write up something that says things about designs, functions, problems, many different things. Communication is also one of the most important aspects of engineering.  The phrase, “Two minds are greater than one” is applicable to engineers because engineers feed off each other’s work and ideas.  Without communication in the engineering world a lot of problems would go unsolved because people would only be looking at it from one direction.  With the help of other engineers solutions to problems can be solved with teamwork and communication. Most people don’t really know what goes on behind the scenes in terms of research and writing for an engineer.  In this essay I will write about a scholarly article from engineering, a trade publication from engineering, an interview with a Teacher’s Assistant from a basic engineering class, and an interview with an engineer.  All of these will help the reader get a clearer view of what researching, communicating, and writing are like for an engineer. </p>
			<p>Research needs to be done on a large scale in the field of engineering.  At almost every college across the United States that teach engineering, research is being done to further advance knowledge in these fields. In a scholarly article about the importance of research in the field of engineering Andrew Zydney wrote, “The past 30 years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of programs dedicated to involving engineering students in undergraduate research activities. The first institution-wide undergraduate research program at a major research university was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969, and this was followed by similar programs throughout the country. The National Science Foundation began providing financial support for such efforts in 1987 through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, which was specifically designed to attract talented students into research careers in science and engineering.” (Zydney) Clearly as time goes on research is becoming more important in the field of engineering.  Research projects were also used to draw student in during the early 80’s.  This was an intro to the paper that explains research that was done on how undergraduate research affected students.  The terminology used was not very technical because the author was simply explaining the background of engineering research very briefly.  Most of the time research is done to better understand technology that is being built.  Tests may be run on many different aspects of the project like reliability, safety, power, and many other things. All of these tests are done to make sure whatever the engineers are working on is ready for the public when it is released.  When companies have to do recalls on a product, and engineer somewhere did not do their job properly.  This is due to a failure in the design process, or during the testing process, because companies should know if anything is wrong with their product so they can take the right steps to fix it.  For example companies that make phones such as Apple, Blackberry, and Samsung put their phones through a massive amount of tests due to all the different capabilities of phones.  There is a test where the phone is dropped repeatedly to see how durable the phone really is. Zydney also writes later in his engineering research journal, “Alumni who participated in the Undergraduate Research Program reported a significantly greater enhancement of their ability to speak effectively, understand scientific findings, know literature of merit in the field, and possess clear career goals than either the alumni with self-reported research experience or the no-research group.” (Zydney) Zydney came to these conclusions after asking engineers from 1982 to 1987 to take surveys on whether or not undergraduate research was helpful to them.  Based off the answers he was given almost all undergraduate students said that research was very helpful in the progression of their career. In the second part of Zydney’s essay he wrote much more technically about things to better describe his research. Engineers write most essays very technically by never using pronouns and using getting very in depth about different components of the project they are working on. Research provides students with a chance to actually know what it is like to be an engineer before they are in the workforce.  Research is a very important aspect of engineering that every engineer will deal with at some point in their career.</p>
			<p>Another key aspect in engineering is communication.  Engineers always work in teams at the professional level.  Without communication there is no way a team can successfully solve a problem. An engineer without communication skills is like a baker without dough, it simply doesn’t work out.  One of the first things that universities try to teach to freshman engineers is the importance of communication.  At Michigan State every engineer must take a class where they work in team on different projects throughout the semester such as a robot, solar powered car, and more.  In a trade publication about engineering Michelle LaBrosse writes, “When a project is directed by agreement, project changes often mean a re-launch of the project. It's better to spend half a day re-launching based on the new project agreement than to create a final deliverable that no one wants, or to attempt to complete a project with inadequate resources and lack of support from the project sponsor.” (LaBrosse)  LaBrosse explains that it’s better to communicate and create a good project than to not communicate and make a product that no one will want or does not work properly.  The way LaBrosse writes in this article is much different than the article in the last paragraph.  In the last paragraph the author was much more technical and drew results from his research, and based many of his topics around the specifications of his research. In this publication from “Control Engineering” the author is much less professional and more personal with her essay.  She has no facts in her essay to back her points up, she just uses her own thoughts.  This essay does not seem peer reviewed.  The essay from the last paragraph seemed much cleaner as if it had been read from two different points of view and corrected.  The trade publication is less formal and you can easily tell.  Later on in the essay LaBrosse writes, “The next time you conjure up a stereotype of yourself as a non-communicator, think about communication as a business lubricant--one that makes systemic detours bearable and understandable to team members. Think of communication as a tool that clarifies, illuminates, and unifies, and ultimately brings you closer to the goal that is just ahead.” (LaBrosse)  Labrosse writes here about how important communication is too companies and that good communication results in the completion of projects and problems. Many companies usually have team building activities to promote communication in the workplace. Nothing can be done without communication and even more so in the engineering world.  Communicating with other engineers may not be easy for some because engineers aren’t traditionally the best with people. But once you get them working together as a team they can solve any problem.</p>
			<p>To get a closer look at what it means to write, communicate, and do research I conducted an interview with an EGR 100 teachers assistant.  The first question I asked him was how important is writing, research, and communication in the world of engineering? His immediate answer was very important. He then said “Writing, communication, and research are all major parts to engineering that all feed off of each other.  You need to communicate to do research, and then write to explain your results. Communication is one of the pillars that holds up engineering.  Without communication very little would be possible for engineers”.  This teacher’s assistant has a very important job.  He teaches engineering at the most basic level.  Anyone who plans on becoming an engineer at Michigan State University has to take this basic engineering course.  Without an interesting teacher’s assistant someone could lose interest in engineering and change their major.  From the first day in class we were put in groups to help grow our communication skills.  An assignment was given to us and as a team we were supposed to do it.  We would trade ideas, build off each other’s ideas, and even shoot down others ideas when necessary. Although we have worked in groups throughout high school, it is very different in the school of engineering.  In high school usually one person ends up doing most of the workload because others are too lazy to do it.  But in engineering everyone contributes ideas and split the work up evenly.  When I asked the T.A. about what he thinks about one person doing a majority of the work he gave me an interesting response, “I do not support lazy people who make others do their work, but the one person who does all the work is getting much more experience than the others who sit back and watch.  The one doing the work is probably much more likely to become a great engineer because he is showing leadership qualities along with constructive ideas”.  Developing leadership qualities is also important as an engineer.  If you want to move up higher on the engineering ladder you need leadership qualities.  An easy way to develop these is by picking up the workload when others fail to do so.  Although a leader is not chosen for every project, there is always someone who steps up.  It will also usually be that person who ends up with a successful career. This applies to all fields of study not just engineering. I then asked my T.A. how important he thinks it is for undergraduates to do some sort of research during their time at Michigan State.  He responded to this question by saying, “doing research at Michigan State will help your career in many ways.  It looks great on job applications and also helps you get some experience of what it’s like to work as an engineer and solve real problems”.  Although I have not done any research yet, I completely agree with what he said.  Research is widely available to students enrolled in the engineering college at Michigan State, and I plan on doing some at some point here.  But from a person who teaches all basic engineers, he says research is key in becoming a successful engineer.</p>
			<p>In order to get a full look of what it means to read, write, and communicate as an engineer I needed to get information from someone who is already in the work force.  To do this I turned to my Father.  He studied electrical engineering at Michigan State back in the day and he now is the director of hardware engineering at Research in Motion (Blackberry).  So you could definitely say my father has succeeded as an engineer.  Straight out of college he worked for Cobra, then spent a long period of time working for Motorola.  There he helped design and engineer dozens of phones over his career there.  He does the same thing now at Research in motion.  I have been on many “take your child to work days” so I have a small visualization of what being an engineer is like.  When I asked him how important communication is in the workplace he said, “Communication is the most important part of a successful engineering project.  There are many different components of a project which requires different teams to work on different parts of the project.  In my case I work with phones, so one team will be working on the software side of the phone while others work on the hardware.  If these teams don’t communicate and work together nothing would ever get done.”  My father is always on some sort of conference calls. Often times they are late at night because he has to be on the phone with people from Thailand because that’s were almost everything is manufactured these days.  He does his best to communicate with every member of his team.  If you work in an environment where everyone is open minded and not afraid to express their ideas freely then a lot will end up getting done.  When I asked my dad what is done in terms of writing in his workplace he said, “Progress reports are very important because this helps us understand where everyone is at.  With so many different aspects of a project it is easy to lose track of where we are in terms of progress.  We have time tables and due dates for these projects to keep us on track. Many different tests are applied to the phones we make, and early on in the design process many of these tests are failed.  Communication is key in solving these issues as soon as possible.” Once again my father stressed how important communication is, but writing is a part of this communication.  Simply sending an email can be considered writing, and my father could receive nearly a hundred emails in just one day.  Writing in engineering is strictly technical. Topics of discussion are schematics, different pieces to a project, computer programming, and many other different technical ideas.  Progress reports usually start off with an introduction to the problem that is trying to be solved, talk about what they are currently working on such as a specific test on the project, and end with a plan for the future.  This might include ideas that need to be changed or due dates that need to be met.  I can only hope to have a career as successful as my fathers but I am currently on the same track as him.  Clearly engineering cannot happen without communication, because everyone I have talked to has said in order to become a good engineer you have to be a good communicator. Good writing and reading skills are important to an engineer but not nearly as important as communication.</p>
			<p>The secret to completing well done, problem solving projects is communication in the engineering world.  Virtually all engineering projects are done in teams, and anyone can agree the formula of a good team involves communication. Research is also a great way for an engineer to progress not only his skills but his career as well. Many different opportunities are given to students to pursue some sort of research, and from what I’ve heard from a Teacher’s assistant, and a successful engineer it will help me greatly on my way to the engineering work force.  Writing is also a component of the communication factor to tell other members of a project where you are at, and what needs to be done. The technicalities of projects are almost always the topic of writing during engineering. Engineers are all about finishing things on time and finishing them well, communication helps them do this. All in all reading, writing, research, and communication are pillars in the building that is engineering.  Without these components the building would fall.  In other words whatever project is being done by engineers, if they don’t successfully use the components then the project is unlikely to succeed.</p>
