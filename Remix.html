					<h1>Remix Proposal Project</h1>

			<h2> Remix Memo </h2>
			<p>We choose to remix a member of our groups lived experiences project.  He wrote on how members of our society are overusing social media, especially in teenage girls.  We split up the work evenly at the beginning of the project.  Composing the documentary helped me better understand the issue by showing me that there is a large amount of people in our world that overuse social media.  It also showed me that there are certain stereotypes that people believe use social media more than others, stereotypes like white teenage girls.  Some problems our group encountered while composing our documentary was to not enforce these stereotypes, but still expose them to the audience.  We selected this topic because it was the one we were most interested in of all our past projects. The most challenging part of the project was probably filming and assembling all our pieces of film.  Because each member of our group interviewed different people about this topic, we had to assemble all the videos into one.  We took a very systematic approach because we distributed the work evenly and all did the work we were supposed to. Our group talked a lot over the last two weeks about how we would assemble the film and what each of us would film.  Communication was key in assembling this video because as we only meet as a group in class, we used google docs and text messaging to put together the pieces of the film.  Working in groups was very beneficial because it not only lightened the total workload, but it also provided a chance to get different ideas on how the video should be put together.  It also helped with generating ideas about our topic. I planned my work pretty well for this project by filming my piece of the video the first week the project was assigned, and writing my memo the week the documentary was due.  I wrote the memo last because I needed a clear view on the ideas our video portrayed as well as how we worked together as a group.  If I had more time to do this project I probably wouldnâ€™t have done anything different because I evenly distributed my work over the last three weeks which resulted in a stress free process.  The design decisions were made democratically.  Everyone in the group had an equal say about how we should put the video together.  All in all our group worked very effectively together and we distributed the work evenly which resulted in an easy going work process and a good video.</p>
