					<h1>Cafeteria Food/Eating at State</h1>
					<p>One of the main changes I’ve had to deal with at state is my different diet.  At home I was very spoiled to have a mother that would cook a meal almost every day.  These meals are on a different level compared to the meals I’ve been eating at state.  At MSU you could be lucky to get 2 good meals a week, other than that the food here is not very good.  In the dorm that I live in, Wilson, they offer the same exact food every day.  Variety is a crucial in having a good diet, as well as staying satisfied with your meals.  When I go to Wilson’s dining hall I know for sure I’m getting pasta, a sandwich, or some cereal.  In high school my mom would surprise me with a succulent meal every night.  One of the main things I look forward to when going home is my mom’s cooking for sure.  I’m not trying to sound stuck up but my Mother on average is a significantly better cook than most other moms.  The different flavors she brings into every meal catches me off guard every time.  Here at state I am almost never surprised with my meals.  I can look at every meal and tell how it’s going to taste without even putting it in my mouth.  I was blessed to have Thanksgiving at my house this year and wow was it good.  My mother was laboring for days in the kitchen to prepare a feast for me and my family.  And might I add that it was worth every second of her time.  Also eating meals at MSU just isn’t the same as a family dinner.  Sitting down with your friends and having a meal is great, but when the whole family is at the dinner table sharing a home cooked meal it really doesn’t get any better.  The food here is nowhere near as healthy as my mother’s cooking.  At home my mom will force me to finish my vegetables just like when I was in 3rd grade.  The problem at state is that I can get pizza or a burger every day.  I try to stay away from unhealthy meals but they always find a way to sneak in to my meal plan.  Another problem is that fountain drinks are always available.  I rarely drink soda but for other people this could be a problem.  The point I’m trying to get at is that dining hall food is significantly worse than what my mom can cook up. I would like to give a big thanks to my mom as well for spoiling me as a child and making my standards for food higher than your average college student. </p>
					<h1>Writng Class Year in Review</h1>
					<p>I was skeptical about the hybrid class because I was told it was half online.  I have never taken an online course in anything so I was excited to see what it was like.  The class would meet once a week on Wednesdays and our teacher would assign a new paper or lead us through an in-class assignment.  One thing I would definitely redo though if I started the class over is to stay ahead with my workload.  I often found myself writing essays the day before they were due.  I also left myself a ridiculous amount of work to do the week before finals week.  I finished all the code academy in one day, which was very stressful to say the least. I will say though I enjoyed learning how to write HTML and I see myself using it in the future to do something.  It is definitely a great skill to have, especially as an engineer. I know how websites are built now and I am intrigued to use my new HTML writing skills. A lot of people don’t know how to write HTML, so I gained a skill that will put me ahead of the group.  But at the beginning of the semester I kind of knew I would do this.  I am notorious for putting things off to the last minute, and that is definitely the case with this class.  I am going to be honest our teacher could have gone in to more detail about these projects that are worth a major portion of our grade.  Sometimes she would cover them in like 5 minutes leaving half the class clueless as to what’s going on.  But through reading the prompt and asking each other we could find out what we needed to do for the projects.  Other things I should have done different in this class is use my peer reviews better.  I used the reviews for a couple of the essays but for some of the essays I didn’t even look at the reviews which wouldn’t do me any good.  Some advice I would give to my teacher would be to not use such complicated words and such in the prompt.  It sounds like a comment a fourth grader would make, but sometimes with the complicated words I was confused about what I was writing about.  I would also recommend to get rid of group projects.  The multimedia remix project was ok, but when the class was supposed to make a website together that was a little illogical.  It is hard for a class of different cultures to communicate together enough to make the website.  It would be hard for any group of 20 or so people to communicate well enough on a project as complicated as this.  Granted everyone was split up into teams but with a class that only meets once a week good communication is hard to get.  All in all though I am happy with this class. My writing skills developed and I also learned the great skill of writing HTML.</p>
					<h1>NBA</h1>
					<p>The NBA season started in October and I am a huge fan of basketball in general.  I’ve spent my whole life growing up in the Chicago area, so I’ve always been a fan of the Bulls.  This a very soft spot for me though this year with the devastating injury of Derrick Rose.  He missed the whole year and for him to hurt the other knee is truly heartbreaking.  I’m not kidding when I say this I almost shed a tear when I heard the news. Chicago planned on not having Derrick Rose last year so they built their team to win without them. This year is a completely different story.  Derrick Rose was supposed to return and be Chicago’s savior.  But the injury has put the team into complete chaos.  The offense was based around Derrick Rose and now someone has to step up and become the leader of the team. Coming from Chicago everyone was anticipating the return of Derrick Rose and the possible dethroning of the Miami Heat and LeBron James.  LeBron James is the hero/villain of the NBA.  He is loved by many, and hated by many more.  I was hoping this year that the Bulls could be the hero of the NBA and stop his reign in the NBA.  Chicago is also the home of the greatest basketball player to ever play, Michael Jordan.  LeBron is definitely in pursuit of that title.  If he keeps winning championships he will legitimately be able to argue that he is the best. The world will really never know who the best of all time was though.  Another team I am a fan of in the NBA is the Golden State Warriors.  I am a big fan of Stephen Curry and former MSU basketball player Draymond Green.  I have no affiliation to San Francisco but I have always been a fan of the players on that team.  Any NBA player who attended Michigan State will be a favorite player of mine.  I play a lot of basketball myself so watching the best basketball players in the world play is always a good time for me.  Because I came to a school in Michigan there are many Pistons fans I have to deal with.  They take every chance they can to talk trash about the Bulls and praise the heat.  Both the teams are in the same conference so you could call them rivals. When the Pistons play the Heat our floor gets very hostile.  There is still plenty of NBA to watch this year so we are in for an exciting season!</p>
					<h1>Hip-Hop</h1>
					<p>Music is a key part of my life.  One thing I can guarantee I do every day is listen to music.  My favorite genre of music is Hip-Hop by far.  I’m going be honest I very rarely listen to any other genre of music.  Back in my hometown a lot of people listen to country music, and if there’s one thing I hate in this world its country music.  I seriously hate country music so much.  I hate the concepts of the songs, they style, everything about it.  But here at Michigan State no one listens to country music and I LOVE it.  I guarantee most fans of country music despise hip-hop just as much as I hate country music. In my opinion Hip-Hop deals with much more social issues than country music.  Country music deals with sappy love stories and weak lyrics in my opinion.  I could definitely win an argument that hip-hop is much more poetic than country music. There are 2 ways of rapping really, writing and free styling. Writing is where you know what you are going to say before you get into the recording studio.  This allows rappers to be poetic and hide different meanings inside their lyrics.  Free styling on the other hand takes much more skill and can range from being great to awful.  Free styling is where you play a beat for a rapper and he comes up with lines as he goes in his head.  Watching someone freestyle well is really a sight to see.  Kendrick Lamar who is possibly the best free style rapper in the game right now.  He can put double meanings to lines, address social issues, diss other rappers, and link together rhymes that’ll leave your head spin. He does this all of the top of his head.  Rapping is also the least expensive music to make.  Almost all other types of music need a band to hold things together and keep rhythm.  Rap on the other hand has a beat that can change as the song goes on.  Producers make beats for rappers, and rappers lay tracks on those beats.  In my opinion a rap song needs four things to be a good song, flow, lyrics, beat, and delivery.  Every rapper has their own flow which is how quickly they move through their lyrics and how well they link their rhymes together.  Lyrics are a key part too. This depends on the rapper. Everyone can rhyme but only good rappers can connect witty lines to smart lyrics with a meaning. The beat is what puts style on the song and links everything together.  The flow and lyrics have to fit in perfectly with the beat for a great song. Delivery is how rappers put emphasis on their lyrics.  If a rapper can combine good delivery with the hard hitting sections of the beat great sounds.  Rapping is much more technical than most people think and when they realize this people can appreciate it much more.</p>
					<h1><em>The Social Network</em></h1>
					<p>During one of our classes we watched the movie The Social Network which is a cinematic movie based off the life of Mark Zuckerberg and the creation and controversy around the social network site Facebook.  While the movie was pretty much based around Mark’s life, it addressed some deeper topics such as the effect technology is having on communication and writing. The amount of human interaction is getting smaller because of, surprisingly, social networks.  A site that’s supposed to bring people closer is actually driving them apart.  More and more people are interacting through twitter and Facebook and aren’t developing good social skills. Before the internet people had no way of interacting with each other besides phone calls, mail, and face to face contact.  Now we have hundreds of ways to talk to people through the internet.  People use social media all the time to say things that they are too scared or too nervous to say in person.  Back in the day if you had a problem with someone you would just fight it out with your fists and be cool.  Now people are fighting over twitter and Facebook.  Granted some people might say this is better than fighting, but I personally believe if a person has a problem with another person they should just duel it out.  It could just be people yelling at each other but all problems should be solved face to face not computer screen to computer screen.  People who are timid people and nervous to talk to others don’t develop social skills now either.  They talk to people through the internet.  They saying that people would rather have four quarters then a hundred pennies applies to this situation.  Before people would have a close knit group of friends but now people have hundreds of meaningless friends on social media.  I think this a serious issue and if we don’t do something about it kids are going to become less and less social. Humans are meant to interact with others and sitting on a computer screen talking to other people does nothing for you.</p>
					<h1>Thanksgiving Break</h1>
					<p>I’ve really never looked forward to Thanksgiving break as much as I did this year.  With all the school work I have been doing it was really nice to have a break and see my friends.  Back in high school it was cool to have a couple days off but in college this seemed like the second coming of Jesus.  It was also the first time I came home since coming to State so I was feeling homesick.  This break definitely cured that homesickness.  I got to spend a lot of time with my family and friends which is what Thanksgiving is all about.  I really missed my best friends from high school and I saw all of them over break. It was great to hear that they were doing well and enjoy their schools.  On Thanksgiving Day my family ran a 5k turkey trot together, even our dog was allowed to run in the race!  The 3.2 mile run was crucial because of the giant meal I would consume later in the day.  My Grandparents and my Uncles Family came to our house over break too so I had a chance to see them which was really nice.  Our family has a weird kind of obsession with the movie The Sound of Music starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.  I’m going to be honest I know that movie way to well for an 18 year old boy.  It is my favorite movie for sure, all the songs are too classic and the story is heartwarming.  So in between the Turkey Trot and dinner we all watched it together, and even sang along to some of the songs.  All day my mom was laboring in the kitchen to make our feast.  When dinner time came around and the 25 pound turkey was finished cooking the whole family feasted.  I ate until I was uncomfortably full and had to lay down.  After all the family activities were done for the day I met up with some friends and we enjoyed our time together.  When it was time to go home my Mom dropped my off at the train station and I took the train into Union Station in Chicago.  Then after an hour and a half of downtime the train for East Lansing left the station and I was on my way back to good ol’ East Lansing. What a great break!</p>
					<h1>The Legalization of Marijuana</h1>
					<p>The legalization of marijuana is a legal issue that is becoming more and more controversial in our society.  It is already becoming more and more accepted in our community today.  This is such a controversial topic now because it is easy to argue either side and there are so many people that are enthusiastic about each side.  Some of the pros of medical marijuana would be that it would be easily taxable for a government that is struggling to meet ends these days.  Another positive is that there are people who need this medicine and are being deprived of the proper treatment.  There are probably more pros to for this issue.  But on the other side of the hand people can argue against it. Old timers frown upon smoking marijuana because of their old ideas that it is bad for you. It is proven that marijuana is way safer than alcohol. The government is just being stubborn about legalizing it because they receive a ridiculous amount of money to fight the war against drugs.  Marijuana is still considered a class 1 drug, which is in the same class as heroine. It is also still very illegal to the federal government.  This makes a strong clashing point between state government and federal government.  In Colorado it has been 100% legalized.  On January 1 in Denver, Colorado people will be able to buy marijuana legally without a medical card or anything. In many ways this a good thing.  The demand for marijuana will always exist.  Right now the market is completely uncontrolled which is a main reason for legalization.  I can guarantee you people are going to consume marijuana whether or not the government legalizes it so it makes zero sense to keep something illegal that could make the government a ridiculous amount of money if they legalized it and put taxes on it.  Even if the government wanted to keep the drug out of the hands of children, legalizing would be the best option.  It is definitely easier for teens to get marijuana then it is to get alcohol.  Alcohol is strictly regulated while street dealers are in control of the marijuana market which makes things very unsafe for users. All in all I really don’t understand why marijuana is illegal.  First off the country would make a lot of money of taxes, and save a bunch because they wouldn’t be fighting the war on drugs.  It would be a controlled substance then and harder to get in to the hands of children.  I think the prohibition of marijuana will be over in the next 10 years for sure so I guess patience is a virtue.</p>
					<h1>Michigan State Football</h1>
					<p>I was lucky to have my first year at Michigan State be one of the best years MSU has had in the last couple decades regarding football.  I thought our team would be decent this year but I did not expect to do this well.  Tomorrow is the Big Ten Championship and Michigan State is pretty much guaranteed a spot in the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1988. I attended every single home game except for the one where I was home over Thanksgiving break. And might I add I had a great time at every game. I wasn’t surprised with our first 3 wins, but one win I was very happy about was the win versus Michigan.  This was definitely the most hyped up game of the year and the Spartans pulled through.  Being that it was also Halloween weekend it was a crazy weekend to say the least.  The Spartans went undefeated in conference play which was also a great achievement.  My father was in the marching band the last time Michigan State was in the Rose Bowl so he is probably even more excited about this game than I am.  Ohio State will be a tough challenge but I think the Spartans have a chance to be big ten Champions. I am not as enthusiastic for MSU football as I am for MSU basketball but it still feels great to be the 11th team in the nation.  I have a lot of friends that go to different big ten schools so it is always fun to mess around with them about how my school is better than them at football. This is great for the school to be this good this year because it helps draw better recruits which will make us better in the future.  Our defense has been the backbone of our team this year by far.  The offense has been good enough to win the games but our defense is definitely why we are good this year.  It has been an amazing year for MSU Football and it’s not even over yet! Hopefully MSU can add 2 more wins and finish 13-1 which would be one of the best years MSU has ever had if they can get a Rose Bowl Championship.</p>
					<h1>Blackhawk's Stanley Cup Season</h1>
					<p>Just over the last 4 years I have become a serious Chicago Blackhawks fan.  They won the Stanley Cup in 2011 and that was when I really got drawn in to the sport of hockey.  I had a friend who was a huge fan and when they made the playoffs in 2011 I watched almost every playoff game. It was love at first sight.  I will completely admit I was a bandwagon fan in 2011 but after that hockey really grew on me. I am a baseball player and I watched a lot of baseball which is a much slower paced game than hockey.  When I saw how fast hockey was played and how physical it was, I needed more.  I didn’t know much about hockey at the point but the 2012 season I watched nearly every single Blackhawks game. Over that season I learned a lot about the NHL, The Blackhawks, and the rules of hockey.  Granted they made it far in the playoffs that year they didn’t win the cup.  My love for the Blackhawks grew even more next year.  It was a shortened season because of the NHL lockout. But the Blackhawks didn’t let it get to them they started with the best start to a NHL season ever.  They played really well throughout the regular season and got a good seed in the playoffs.  They won their first two rounds and faced off against the Red Wings in the semifinals.  This is one of my biggest pet peeves about MSU is all the Red Wings fan. Being a die-hard Blackhawks fan has made life hard in a world full of Red Wings fans.  The rivalry between the Blackhawks and Red Wings has always been really fierce and competitive.  But anyway the Hawks were down 3-1 and came back to win the series and eventually win the Stanley Cup.  It was amazing, Chicago had a parade that over 2 million people came too. I was one of those people.  I climbed on top of a bride over the Chicago River to get my look at the Cup, and boy was it beautiful.  Perfect ending to a perfect season.  Hopefully the Blackhawks can bring the cup back to Chicago this year!</p>
					<h1>Basketball at MSU</h1>
					<p>I am a huge basketball fan, you probably already knew that if you read my previous blog about the NBA. But this blog is about my basketball life at MSU.  Both my parents went to Michigan State, so I was born and raised as a Spartan.  I have been watching MSU basketball for over ten years and my love for Spartan basketball will only grow over the next four years.  I have season tickets to MSU basketball currently. Although MSU just recently lost the #1 ranking, it will make them a much better team later on.  I didn’t think MSU was going to hold the number one ranking very long but I was very happy to have it while we did.  This is the first time in 13 years that a MSU student has been able to say they have the #1 school at basketball.  I took every chance I could to rub this in my friend’s faces.  Granted this did backfire on me when MSU lost and everyone trash talked me about the loss to North Carolina. Teams learn more from their losses than they do from their wins so I am confident we are a better team after that loss.  Tom Izzo is also notorious for being a machine in the tournament every year, and I have high expectations for this year, possibly championship dreams.  Our team is very experienced and we only lost one senior from last year which makes us more mature than other teams.  MSU basketball isn’t the only piece to this blog though.  I have found myself spending more and more time in the pickup basketball gyms at IM West.  I conditioned for baseball all my previous winters so I never had a chance to develop my basketball skills. But now that I no longer play basketball I need something to feed my competitive side and pickup basketball is the perfect way to do it.  I get a great exercise while playing a game that I love.  I usually round up 5 guys on my floor and we take our skills to the court.  All though we are freshman and lose a lot, we are getting a lot better.  Pickup basketball is a great outlet for stress too.  I can go on the court and just forget about everything except for the game. Hopefully I can get better so I can destroy freshman when I am a senior.  Clearly coming to MSU has caused a growth in my love for the sport of basketball.</p>
					<h1>Weather</h1>
					<p>The weather at MSU this year has been typical Midwest weather.  I grew up in the Midwest so I wasn’t expecting a difference in the weather, and I was 100% correct.  The only thing I have been surprised about is the amount of rain we have gotten.  It seemed like for a month straight it was either overcast or raining.  I always ride my bike everywhere and the rain caused my seat to be wet all the time so I couldn’t sit down on my seat unless I wanted my pants to get wet.  We had one minor snowfall which is pretty typical around Thanksgiving time.  Now that it is December though I expect more snow to come.  Last year in Illinois we didn’t have a white Christmas and that was pretty depressing.  I’m hoping for better this year because Christmas without snow on the ground is like eating pancakes without syrup.  It just can’t happen.  The temperature has been higher than I expected for the month of November though.  Usually that is when the temp drops and everything begins to freeze but it is the beginning of December and the temperature is just now getting to be the bitter Midwest cold that we all love so much.  People complain about Midwest weather but there is really nothing I love more than a Midwest winter. The cold air on your face feels amazing and when you take a deep breath it cools your whole body.  Winter is also my favorite season because of activities like ice fishing, pond hockey, and snowboarding.  Obviously it is the beginning of winter and these activities aren’t happening yet but it is beginning to happen.  A week or two of freezing weather is what we need to freeze all the local ponds and rivers which make ice fishing and pond hockey possible.  Hopefully by the time winter break is over ill have a couple days of ice fishing and some games of pond hockey under my belt. Most people aren’t hoping for the temperature to drop but that’s all I want.  Hopefully winter lasts all the way in March this year!</p>
					<h1>Video Games</h1>
					<p>A great way to pass the time in college if you aren’t preoccupied with schoolwork is to play video games.  You can take your mind off whatever it’s thinking about and just game.  The fall season is always when the best games are released because it’s right before Black Friday and Christmas time where game producers are looking to make the most money.  A popular genre of game is the first person shooter.  This fall 2 big games came out, Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghosts.  Each game is very well made and surprised me on how much graphics have advanced over the years.  Not to mention the release of Grand Theft Auto Five which made a profit of 800 million the day it was released.  This is one of the most in-depth free world games made to date.  Everything is so detailed and good looking in the virtual world.  Things like this inspire me to be an engineer.  When I see some sort of technology that boggles my mind I know that an engineer somewhere is behind it.  This makes me want to be the engineer that blow other people’s minds.  Technology will continue to advance and so will the video game world. I plan on being a mechanical engineer so I won’t dealing with video games but students I am in class with right now will play a role in the development of the technology of the future.  Children these days seemed to be attached to technology, especially video games.  Not saying it’s a good thing that children are becoming more and more obsessed with technology but it will provide a constant supply of jobs for people like me.  A controversy around the development of these near realistic video games is that they are too violent too play.  If you want more info about this go over to the cultural analysis tab where I wrote an in depth essay about the advancement of violence in video games and the effects they have on youth.  If a person is mature enough these games pose no threats what so ever.  Everyone matures differently and parents have to be aware of what their kids are playing.  All in all video games are a good way to take your mind off things and have a good time.</p>
					<h1>Things I've Started Doing At State</h1>
					<p>Since I’ve moved into college and gotten used to the college lifestyle I’ve started doing things differently and I’ve also seen some changes in my lifestyle.  One of the things I’ve become more aware of is my over health and fitness. Back in high school my baseball team would work out every day and my mom would always be cooking me healthy meals.  Not once did me getting out of shape cross my mind.  Once I got to MSU it would be easy for me to start eating unhealthy and not work out.  I have become conscious of that and have started eating healthy and working out consistently.  Most people put on weight when they go to college but I haven’t put on anything yet, which I’m pretty happy about.  Another thing that probably happens to most college students that I’ve started doing is drinking coffee. I can’t get enough of it. I’m pretty sure you can get addicted to coffee and I am well on my way to becoming a coffee addict. It’s a great way to wake yourself up for that early class, or to get on the grind late at night when you’re tired.  Something that I have also start to do surprisingly is read the newspaper.  I never really had time before and I wasn’t very interested.  Here at State I can get the New York Times every week day for free.  I like to take it back to my room and slowly read through it.  College is all about finding a medium between relaxing and working very hard.  Reading the newspaper not only keeps me up to date with what’s going on in the world, but it’s a great way to pass an hour of your time.  Stories are often very intriguing because the New York Times is such a praised newspaper with great writers.  It opened me up to a whole world of new that I never knew about.  When I go home on break it’s going to be weird to have a cup of coffee and read the newspaper with my parents for the first time.  I can see myself maturing and starting to pay attention more to things that matter for my future. College definitely changes people.</p>
					<h1>Chrysler Ad Analysis</h1>
					<p>15.	We were shown a video of the Chrysler ad starring Eminem with his famous song lose yourself playing in the background. We were told to look at this ad analytically by looking at imagery, the voiceover, and the “imported from Detroit” tagline.  Eminem has serious ties to Detroit and his story almost personifies Detroit and Chrysler.  Eminem started with nothing in a trailer park and through self-determination he has become one of the most prolific rappers in rap history.  It is safe to say he is the greatest Caucasian rapper to be in the game.    Detroit is known for being a rough city, and the car industry just recently turned around and is on its way back up, just like Eminem.  That’s why his song is played in the background because it inspires people from Detroit to work their way up to the top.  The line “Imported from Detroit” just generates pride for the city.  Chrysler wants to be known as the car company from Detroit because there’s something about an American car made in Detroit that appeals to the average American.  The voiceover is a deep voice that gets people fired up for their city.  This whole commercial is trying to inspire pride in Detroit, and pride in America.  They show great shots of the city that make Detroit look like a city trying to re-invent itself, just like Chrysler.</p>
					<h1>Christmas Break Plans</h1>
					<p>Christmas break is less than a week away and I couldn’t be more excited.  I get to spend time with all my closet friends from my high school who all went to different universities across the U.S. I only have got to see my friends over the short Thanksgiving break so with the 3 weeks we have off I will be able to spend a lot of time with my good friends.  A couple of my best friends go to University of Wisconsin-Madison and I might be planning a trip up there before they come home for winter break.  It will be cool to see what a different big ten campus is like and what they do for fun.  Wisconsin and Michigan State don’t have much of a rivalry so I would imagine people would be friendly with me. The things I might be looking forward to the most is my mom’s cooking.  Getting away from cafeteria food for a month is going to be amazing. My mom always cooks fondue on Christmas Eve, and surprises us with an amazing meal on Christmas every year.  Last year we had Crab Legs that were so dank.  Not to mention that Christmas time is the greatest time of the year.  Everyone is happy and thankful for what they have.  Christmas is also a time to visit family.  This year my family is visiting relatives in Michigan the week before Christmas this year.  My family throws a big Christmas party every year that my immediate family hasn’t attended for 6-7 years.  It will be great to celebrate the holiday season with my close relatives.  We will spend the week after New Year’s Eve in Michigan skiing as a family.  I have only gone snowboarding once over the last year and I am really craving the slopes.  I received a new snowboard last year for Christmas and I only got to use it once.  The one time I used my snowboard was like butter on a hot skillet.  I was flying down the hill at high speeds.  My parents are going to drop me off at State directly after our trip so Winter break is going to fly by this year.  Another thing that will be great about break is to be away from the stress of school.  I will have no work to do in between semesters which will result in a stress free me.  Hopefully my grades were good enough this first semester to enjoy my break correctly.</p>
