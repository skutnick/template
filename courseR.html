					<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
			<p>Over the last semesters, WRA 110 was a writing class that differed from most writing classes at MSU. Not only did we write several different types of essays, we learned how to create a website.  The essays we have written ranged from writing a Narrative to a Formal Research paper.  The purpose of this class was to enhance my writing skills in many different ways.  This was achieved through writing all the different types of essays that required different writing skills.  In the narrative essay I learned how to write through a first person point of view. The cultural analysis essay allowed me to analyze a piece of media in our culture and analyze what it is doing to our society. The formal research project taught us principles of researching and how to assemble that research to prove a point.  Lastly the multimedia remix project developed group skills and video making skills. Clearly several different methods of writing essays were covered in this class. All these essays helped further my skills as a writer, and help me create better essays.</p>
			<p>The first essay we were asked to make was a narrative explaining a piece of technology that has affected our career path.  The piece of technology I said affected me the most were Legos, the childhood toy that has inspired thousands of kids to be creative.  I was no different as a kid, I played with Legos whenever I could from kindergarten to probably 5th grade.  This essay challenged us to write it as a narrative.  So for this essay I would write stories about how Legos set me on the path to being an engineer.  Some of these stories were about how at one point I abandoned the manuals we were given and eventually started making my own creations from scratch. As a young child building things from scratch with nothing but the blueprints I laid out in my mind. In high school almost every essay we wrote was from third person.  This essay allowed me to explore what writing in first person was like.  This was also the first time in a long time I wrote an essay including personal stories.  Not very often have I expressed my stories through writing, it’s normally just through speech.  This essay helped me create techniques to tell my own stories but to also create a point with these stories.  I would tell a story about how as a child I would create my own projects, and through this story I would explain how this inspired me to be an engineer.  The Narrative essay was the first essay I had written since high school so my writing skills were already a little rusty.  But after writing this essay my writing skills were more developed and ready for the next essay.</p>
			<p>The next essay we wrote was much more in depth than the narrative project.  The narrative project was informal because it was from first person view.  The Cultural analysis essay on the other hand was to be much more formal.   This essay asked us to look at an artifact from our society and analyze its effects on our society. There were many different pieces of technology that affect our culture, but I choose to pick the effect of violent video games on children.  This essay was much more challenging to put together than the narrative.  In the narrative all the information I needed was already in my brain.  With the cultural analysis essay I needed to go out and get information about my topic. For this particular essay I got two news articles from the internet that went in to detail about the problem at hand. This was the first time in college I had to do research for a paper so it helped me develop research skills that would come in handy for the next essay.   I used these articles and fit them into my essay to prove my point that violent video games can cause negative effects on the mind of a young child.  This essay was to be written strictly from 3rd person point of view so I couldn’t use any words that related the project to me.  Another thing that was challenging for this project was the assembly of the web version.  This required us to be up to date on code academy. Then after learning the basics of creating a web page I was able to add the cultural analysis essay to my website.  The cultural analysis essay helped me develop several skills.  One was the ability to get research that backs up whatever claim your essay is making.  Another skill was getting used to writing a formal paper.  As an engineer all my papers need to be formal so it is very important to learn how to write these papers effectively. Another thing we did for the cultural analysis essay was review each essay.  So this gave us a chance to revise each essay and work on our essay revision skills.  The cultural analysis essay helped me find the right path to researching topics, and how to create a formal essay.</p>
			<p>The formal research project was the third essay we wrote and probably the hardest.  This essay required us to gather media from a variety of different places and assemble them to show how our major does research, communicates, and writes.  My major is engineering so this wasn’t as hard for me.  Engineers rely on communication for pretty much everything, so I based my essay on how engineers need to communicate to succeed.  I used an internet database to gather my research.  For this essay I developed my researching skills farther because this research was harder to find then the research I needed for the cultural analysis essay.  The formal research project was also the longest essay we had to write the whole year so that added another challenging element to the mix.   This essay definitely pushed me to my limit in terms of writing.  I have never approached a research paper like this so it made me explore a new territory of writing that I have not been before.  Connecting the research to the main point of the essay was the hardest part of this essay. Because of these challenging pieces to this essay my writing skills were developed even more in this essay.  Skills like my ability to draw conclusions from different types of resources.  Because engineers do many different types of research in different areas it was quite easy for me to write about how they conduct their research and how they present their research through writing.  The research project was the hardest project of the year but it was probably the one that helped me the most.</p>
			<p>The final project we had to do was the remix proposal.  We worked in groups for this project and we had to create a documentary about one of the group member’s essays.  For our group we selected someone’s cultural analysis essay about how people are beginning to overuse social media.  This project helped with communication skills because we worked as a team. The first thing we did was split the workload so it would be easier to complete the project.  Working as a team allowed me to develop skills of writing with a group.  The first assignment we had to turn in was a group assignment so we all worked as a team and discussed about how we would go about making our video and how the aesthetics of the video would look.  We then each filmed a piece that would be included into our documentary and compiled all these video to make a grand video.  This project allowed us to use visual analysis to enhance the point we would make with our video.  Also as an attachment to this project we each had to make a memo about the video making process and working in groups.   All in all the remix proposal allowed me to develop skills of writing in a group, making videos that make a point through its visual aspects, and memo writing skills.</p>
			<p>This WRA course covered a wide range of materials. From web design and construction to writing many different types of essays.  Each essay provided me with different sets of skills.  The narrative paper helped me develop writing in first person and proving points through personal stories.  The cultural analysis essay allowed me to start to gain research abilities and write a formal essay in 3rd person. The research paper, the hardest of them all, helped develop my writing skills the most not because it was a long, difficult paper, but because it made me go deep to find research. Then I had to use that research to back up the claims I made in the essay.  The final project helped develop my video creation skills, and also made my group writing skills much better. I would definitely say WRA helped develop my writing skills in many different ways through the several essays we made in the class.</p>
