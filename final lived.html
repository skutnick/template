					<h1>Lived Experiences Project</h1>
			<p>When I was asked what piece of technology has affected my life the most so far I first thought of the present and which pieces of technology I use the most, but I realized I wouldn’t find my answer there.  I thought farther back into my past and then it hit me. If there is a piece of technology that has taken me to where I am today as a mechanical engineer, I believe it would be Legos.  Legos are the simple but elaborate way for kids to build things out of hundreds maybe even thousands of different types of pieces. Building and playing with Legos got me thinking about design and structure from a young age.  I played with them from the age of 6-10 years old, right in the time of important development of a child’s brain.  These small blocks kept me away from playing video games non stop because to me it was more fun to create my own designs then play in a virtual world.  I would get sets for birthdays and Christmas’s since I was a very young child. I would take it out right away and start building whatever it was. Almost every Christmas I could expect a package that if I shook I would hear hundreds if not thousands of small Lego pieces shaking around.  I had sets varying from Harry Potter to Star Wars which allowed me to create my own stories and settings. If I was ever a bad kid, getting my Legos taken away was often a satisfying punishment for my parents to place on me. But taking these away was probably worse for me as a child compared to taking the TV away. There’s just something about Legos for a little kid, they get to build something their self and use their brain doing it. </p> 
			<p> Honestly ask any boy out there if they have built their own project out of Legos, the answer will probably be yes.  One things boys did though is they never actually “played” with whatever they built.  All the fun was in the actual building of the project.  What happened every time was I would build something, keep it for like a week to look at, then just obliterate it. I started off building very small projects as a young child like cars or square houses, basic things. Even working off step by step directions helped me learn how to follow a simple plan. This will carry over when I get into the work force because when I first get a job I’m going to be taking orders from someone. It will be important that I can follow those orders properly.  From this point I started making bigger, better projects.  Where it really affected me was when I went from building off the directions they gave to building my own elaborate projects. Using pieces from different sets to create one larger better looking project. I had a huge bin full of all my Legos in my basement at one point and I can remember countless hours of looking for certain pieces. It seemed like whatever piece I was looking for would never turn up.  My parents still have this huge container full of future projects stored somewhere in the basement.  They plan on letting the grandchildren play with them someday, yeesh. Using this giant bucket I would build things from scratch. No project ever lasted too long after it was built, I was always tearing them down and trying to build either a better version or something brand new. My friend as a child would also come over and we would build things together.  This will help me now in my future career because it helped me develop communication skills when it comes to building something with another person.  Which is basically what my career as a mechanical engineer will be. </p>
			<p>Legos offer children a way to use their imagination and also work their mind while they build something. There was a time where I was building something in my basement.  I spent a lot of time working on whatever this was and my sister came down and just absolutely destroyed it.  I was at first very mad but then I rebuilt it better. This taught me something that will come in handy with engineering as my major, and that is that the first version of something might not be the best.  Trial and error is a major part of engineering because we get things to work easier and faster. Everything needs to be perfect when releasing a product as an engineer because errors will only find their way back to you.  As an engineer you need to be able to recognize these problems and figure out a way to make them not a problem anymore. I gave up playing with Legos a long time ago but the lessons it taught me will always be in me.  Legos have evolved over the years from simple pieces like bricks to hi-tech robots that even young children can build.  When I was a kid there were Harry Potter Legos and now you can get your own Breaking Bad Lego set.  In case you don’t know Breaking Bad is about a middle aged man who cooks methamphetamines. Doesn’t seem like the right thing for young kids to be playing with.  So parents are going to have to keep this one away from children because who wants their kid building a miniature meth lab.  Even in my current engineering class we have to build a project out of an advanced Lego set. In groups of 4 we are creating robots that can follow a line on the ground and detect a light source. We all have to work together to create our own design that will be able to carry a block through an obstacle course. This project is harder than any other Lego project I’ve ever done because it brought a whole other aspect to the project, which would be the programming side of it.  Not only do we need to be able to build a robot that can go through the course, but we need to program the robot as well.   All the things I learned as a kid such as teamwork, creativity, and trial and error are common things I encounter with this project.  From time to time I think of going down into my basement and opening that bin full of thousands of blocks just waiting to be built into something elaborate.</p>
			<p>Legos were definitely one of my favorite toys as a child and it subconsciously taught me lessons on the way. What started as a fascination of building things as a child has blossomed into a career for me. As a mechanical engineer I will be doing what I did as a child, creating and building things. But only now instead of doing it for fun I will be getting paid.  All in all Legos were probably a piece of technology that has affected me most over the course of my long journey to become a mechanical engineer.</p>
